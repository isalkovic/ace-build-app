![ACE Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ot4i/ace-helm/master/appconnect_enterprise_logo.svg?sanitize=true)

## Introduction

IBMÂ® App Connect Enterprise is a market-leading lightweight enterprise integration engine that offers a fast, simple way for systems and applications to communicate with each other. As a result, it can help you achieve business value, reduce IT complexity and save money. IBM App Connect Enterprise supports a range of integration choices, skills and interfaces to optimize the value of existing technology investments.

## Chart Details

By default this chart deploys a single IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers integration server into a Kubernetes environment.

To deploy a production IBM App Connect Enterprise integration server, [check the installation instructions](README.md#installation-for-production).

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.9 or greater, with beta APIs enabled
* If persistence is enabled (see [configuration](#configuration)), then you either need to create a PersistentVolume, or specify a Storage Class if classes are defined in your cluster.

* **Note**: If you are deploying to an IBM Cloud Private environment that does not support these security settings by default. Follow these [instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.0/app_center/nd_helm.html) to enable your deployment.

* If you are using SELinux you must meet the [MQ requirements](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21714191)

To separate secrets from the Helm release a secret can be pre-installed with the following shape and referenced from the Helm chart with the `configurationSecret` value:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <secretName>
type: Opaque
data:
  adminPassword:
  appPassword:
  keystoreCert-<alias>:
  keystoreKey-<alias>:
  keystorePass-<alias>:
  keystorePassword:
  mqsc:
  odbcini:
  policy:
  policyDescriptor:
  serverconf:
  setdbparms:
  truststoreCert-<alias>:
  truststorePassword:
```

The following table describes the secret keys:

Further instructions and helper scripts are provided in the `scripts` directory.

### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation.  Choose either a predefined PodSecurityPolicy or have your cluster administrator create a custom PodSecurityPolicy for you:
* ICPv3.1 - Predefined  PodSecurityPolicy name: [`privileged`](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.0/manage_cluster/enable_pod_security.html)
* ICPv3.1.1 - Predefined PodSecurityPolicy name: [`ibm-anyuid-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp)
* Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:

```

### Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart requires a SecurityContextConstraints to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.


#### Running an ACE Only Integration Server

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints name: [`ibm-anyuid-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart when creating an ACE & MQ integration server, if your target namespace is bound to this SecurityContextConstraints resource you can proceed to install the chart.

Run the following command to add the service account of the Integration server to the anyuid scc - `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user ibm-anyuid-scc system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<releaseName>-ibm-ace-server-rhel-prod-serviceaccount` i.e.
``` 
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user ibm-anyuid-scc system:serviceaccount:default:ace-nomq-ibm-ace-server-rhel-prod-serviceaccount
```

#### Running an ACE & MQ Integration Server

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints name: [`ibm-privileged-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart when creating an ACE & MQ integration server, if your target namespace is bound to this SecurityContextConstraints resource you can proceed to install the chart.

Run the following command to add the service account of the Integration server to the privileged scc. - `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user ibm-privileged-scc system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<releaseName>-ibm-ace-server-rhel-prod-serviceaccount` i.e.
```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user ibm-privileged-scc system:serviceaccount:default:ace-mq-ibm-ace-server-rhel-prod-serviceaccount
```

## Resources Required

This chart uses the following resources by default:

* 1 CPU core
* 1 GiB memory without MQ
* 2 GiB memory with MQ

See the [configuration](#configuration) section for how to configure these values.

## Installing the Chart

First, upload your ACE and/or ACE & MQ images to a Docker registry. You will have to indicate the location of these images in the chart installation.
To build your ACE / ACE & MQ images, read the [instructions in the `ace-docker` repository](https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker).

If using a private Docker registry, an image pull secret needs to be created before installing the chart. Supply the name of the secret as the value for `image.pullSecret`.

**By default this chart installs IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers (without MQ).**

### ACE for Developers installation

1. ACE for Developers only:

To install the chart with the release name `ace-dev`:
```
helm install --name ace-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.aceonly={docker-repo/ace-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag}
```

1. ACE & MQ Advanced for Developers:

To install the chart with the release name `ace-mq-dev`:
```
helm install --name ace-mq-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.acemq={docker-repo/ace-mq-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set queueManagerEnabled=true
```

### ACE installation

1. ACE only:

To install the chart with the release name `ace`:
```
helm install --name ace ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.aceonly={docker-repo/ace-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set devEdition=false
```

1. ACE & MQ Advanced:

To install the chart with the release name `ace-mq`:
```
helm install --name ace-mq ibm-ace --set license=accept --set image.repository.acemq={docker-repo/ace-mq-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set queueManagerEnabled=true --set devEdition=false
```

- **Note:** If installing to a pre-production or production environment, also set `productionDeployment` to `true` on the installation command.

To deploy an IBM App Connect Enterprise server on the Kubernetes cluster this command:
- accepts the [IBM App Connect Enterprise license](../LICENSE)
- sets the docker repository + image name for `aceonly` or `acemq`
- sets the image tag
- sets whether MQ is to be enabled with `queueManagerEnabled`
- sets if the image used is a Developers edition with `devEdition`.
The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

- **Tip**: See all the resources deployed by the chart using `kubectl get all -l release={release-name}`

## Installing a sample image

If you have built your own docker image following the [docker instructions in `ace-docker`](https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker) and you want to test installing the [`sample` image](https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker/sample), we have provided a file `samplevalues.yaml` that has all the values needed to run the sample image.

First run the `generateSecrets.sh` script using the configuration files in scripts/sample-configuration-files to generate the required secrets separate from the Helm release:

```
cd scripts
cp ./sample-configuration-files/* ./
./generateSecrets.sh my-secret {{ .Release.Name }}
```

To install the chart using ACE only and the sample values:

```
helm install --name ace-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept -f=./ibm-ace/samplevalues.yaml --set image.repository.aceonly={docker-repo/ace-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag}
```

To install the chart using ACE & MQ and the sample values:

```
helm install --name ace-mq-dev ibm-ace --set license=accept -f=./ibm-ace/samplevalues.yaml --set image.repository.acemq={docker-repo/ace-mq-image-name} --set image.tag={image-tag} --set queueManagerEnabled=true
```


## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete a `rel1` release:

```
helm delete --purge rel1
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart, except any Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). This is the default behaviour of Kubernetes, and ensures that valuable data is not deleted.

## Extra features in IBM Cloud Private: IBM ACE Dashboard

When installing in IBM Cloud Private you also have access to IBM ACE Dashboard, which provides a UI to manage Integration Servers. You can install the IBM ACE Dashboard for Developers from ICP catalog, search for `ibm-ace-dashboard-dev`. If you have loaded the ACE cloud pack then you can also install the production IBM ACE Dashboard `ibm-ace-dashboard-prod`.

Once the Dashboard is installed, any ACE Integration Servers or ACE & MQ integration servers that are deployed using the installation instructions here will show up in the Dashboard UI.
For these servers to be able to be inspected in the Dashboard, an extra user needs to be added to the installation configuration:
Add an entry for a user with read access named `ibm-ace-dashboard-viewer` to `integrationServer.viewerusers` so the Dashboard UI can display information from the server.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

- **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Storage

When Queue Manager is enabled, the chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) for the storage of MQ configuration data and messages.  By using a Persistent Volume based on network-attached storage, Kubernetes can re-schedule the MQ server onto a different worker node. You should not use "hostPath" or "local" volumes, because this will not allow moving between nodes. The default size of the persistent volume claim is 2Gi.

Performance requirements will vary widely based on workload, but as a guideline, use a Storage Class which allows for at least 200 IOPS (based on 16 KB block size with a 50/50 read/write mix).

For volumes that support onwership management, specify the group ID of the group owning the persistent volumes' file systems using the `fsGroupGid` parameter.

## Logging

The `log.format` value controls whether the format of the output logs is:
- basic: Human readable format intended for use in development, such as when viewing through `kubectl logs`
- json: Provides more detailed information for viewing through Kibana

## Limitations

This Chart can run only on amd64 architecture type.
